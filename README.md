# DataFlash Log Summary

This project focuses on streamlining the process of analyzing log files after each test flight, which currently requires up to 10 minutes per file when done manuallyâ€”and often involves multiple files per test flight. The program significantly improves efficiency by summarizing large files containing up to 2 million messages in approximately 30 seconds.

## Usage

```
git clone git@github.com:[USERNAME]/dataflash-log-summary.git
```

Create a `logs` folder in the root directory.

Move all log files (.BIN) you want to summarize into the `logs` folder.

From your terminal, run `python script.py`.

The script will process each file one-by-one, output the summary of each file, then output the sum of all the files.
